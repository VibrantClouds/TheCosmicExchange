# TCE [The Cosmic Exchange] - Offworld Trading Company Server Implementation (Alpha)

**Status: ✅ Dual-Protocol Infrastructure Complete - Room Operations In Progress**

A reverse-engineered game server implementation that replaces the original SmartFoxServer 2X (SFS2X) infrastructure used by Offworld Trading Company for multiplayer lobby management and P2P game coordination.

Note a CLAUDE.md file in the directory root, while not required, I've personally used it as a tool to deal with boilerplate. Follow good practices. Do not blindly accept what LLM Code Assists recommend. Always be a pilot and guide it, always validate results which come from it. If you do not understand the output, do not accept it.

## 🎯 What This Server Does

This server replaces the original game's lobby infrastructure by implementing the a BlueBox compliant HTTP server used by Offworld Trading Company. The original game connects to `3.90.142.156:9933` (direct SFS2X) with automatic HTTP fallback to port 8080 which we will be using ourselves.


## 🏗️ **Dual-Protocol Architecture**

### Network Protocol Stack (✅ **IMPLEMENTED**)
```
Game Client                    Original Infrastructure              This Server
─────────────────              ──────────────────────              ─────────────────
AmazonManager.Connect()
│
└─ Primary: BlueBox HTTP   -> HTTP Transport (8080)          -> BlueBoxController (8080)
   ├─ HTTP POST             -> /BlueBox/BlueBox.do             -> HTTP POST endpoint
   ├─ Base64 + Pipes        -> Tunneled SFS2X messages        -> SFS2XMessageProcessor
   └─ Polling mechanism     -> Message queue polling          -> Session-based queuing

P2P Transition              -> Unity NAT Facilitation         -> Lobby-to-game handoff (IP/port data)
```

### ✅ **Implemented Core Components**
- **🔧 BlueBoxController** - HTTP endpoint processing pipe-separated commands (port 8080)
- **🔧 Session Manager** - Unified client tracking across both transport methods
- **🔧 Room Manager** - Lobby creation, joining, and 21-element settings management  
- **🔧 Binary Protocol Handler** - Native SFS2X message parsing with proper headers
- **🔧 P2P Data Provider** - Critical IP/port information for lobby-to-game transitions

- [ ] **Integration Testing** - Automated testing for dual-protocol scenarios  
- [ ] **Monitoring & Metrics** - Protocol usage tracking and performance monitoring
- [ ] **Configuration Flexibility** - Dynamic port binding and protocol toggles

### 🚀 **Phase 5: Game Integration (FUTURE)**
- [ ] **Unity P2P Facilitation** - Complete lobby-to-game transition support
- [ ] **Load Testing** - Multi-client stress testing and optimization
- [ ] **Security Hardening** - Input validation and DoS protection
- [ ] **Docker Deployment** - Containerized production deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension

### Running the Server
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd OffworldReverseEng

# Build the solution
dotnet build

# Run the API server
cd src/OffworldLobbyServer.Api
dotnet run

# Server will start on http://localhost:5000
# BlueBox endpoint available at: http://localhost:5000/BlueBox/BlueBox.do
```

### Testing the Connection
```bash
# Test BlueBox connect command
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/BlueBox/BlueBox.do \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "sfsHttp=null%7Cconnect%7Cnull"

# Expected response: connect|SESS_<session_id>
```

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🔧 Protocol Implementation Details

### Port Configuration & Failover Behavior
The SmartFoxServer client uses a dual-port architecture with automatic failover:

**Primary Connection (Port 8080)** 
- BlueBox HTTP transport layer
- Activated when port 9933 is unreachable or redirected
- HTTP-tunneled SFS2X protocol messages

**Observed Wireshark Behavior**: When using IPTables to redirect port 9933/8080 traffic to your replacement server, the game client automatically switches to BlueBox HTTP mode on port 8080 which also needs redirected. This is expected SmartFoxServer failover functionality.

### BlueBox Command Format
The game uses HTTP POST with pipe-separated commands:
```
POST /BlueBox/BlueBox.do
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

sfsHttp={sessionId}|{command}|{data}
```

### Key Protocol Commands
- **connect** - Establish new session: `null|connect|null` → `connect|SESS_<id>`
- **poll** - Long-polling for messages: `SESS_<id>|poll|null` → `poll|<data>` or `poll|null`
- **data** - Send game data: `SESS_<id>|data|<base64_data>` → `data|null`
- **disconnect** - Close session: `SESS_<id>|disconnect|null` → `disconnect|null`

### Critical Lobby Data Structure
The game sends a 21-element SFS2X array containing complete lobby configuration:
```
Index 0:  Lobby name
Index 1:  Lobby type (Public/Friends/Password)
Index 2:  Version compatibility key
Index 3:  Game setup type
Index 4:  Rules set
Index 5:  Replay recording enabled
Index 6:  Map location (Mars/Ceres/Io/Europa)
Index 7:  HQ restrictions (bool array)
Index 8:  AI players enabled
Index 9:  Map size (auto-calculated from player count)
Index 10: Terrain generation type
Index 11: Game speed setting
Index 12: Custom map name
Index 13: Random seed
Index 14: Map latitude
Index 15: Resource minimum
Index 16: Resource presence
Index 17: Colony class
Index 18: Game options (bool array ~32 elements)
Index 19: Team assignments (SFSObject: PlayerID → team)
Index 20: Handicap assignments (SFSObject: PlayerID → handicap)
```
