## Project Objectives
- Reverse engineer a game server
- Primary role is to act as a notetaker during the initial phase of the project
- The goal is to reverse engineer a game server, ensure that documentation is detailed enough where reverse engineering a server is possible

## Documentation Tasks
- Please write findings to a markdown document called NETWORKING.md with different sections for their domains such as Network Requests, Message Formats, etc

## Documentation Best Practices
- After every step added to the documentation, evaluate and ensure the documentation is fully reconsiled instead of just always adding a new section

## Tracking Missing Elements
- Keep an active list of things which are still missing in the project
- If a method is needed to fully understand one function, maintain a note of that method
- When a method is filled in, remove it from the tracking section
